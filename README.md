## Overview

Create an adaptive, micro-segmented network for managing WiFi devices, remote VPN access, and wired devices.

Firewall rules dynamically enforce Policy for fine-grained device connectivity and internet access. 

## How it Works

An unspoofable device identity is established with MAC & Per-Device PSK for WiFi (or a VPN Public Key for Remote Devices). From there, each device gets its own /30 subnet to exist on. Hardening and firewall blocks network attacks -- and routing rules redefine connectivity between devices and to the internet.

## Why SPR Over Alternatives

SPR is built to support an adapative, microsegmented network that unifies WiFi, DNS, Routing, and Policy. It's not easy to bolt on the concepts onto exising router stacks -- while also achieving high assurance security that blocks network spoofing attacks and other network flaws.

## Updating 
#### Building from scratch
```bash
./build_docker_compose.sh
docker-compose up -d
```

For performance and to minimize wear on SD cards, the build uses a memory-backed filesystem. On memory-limited devices, this can cause build failures if memory is exhausted. In this case, you can provide the build argument `--set "*.args.USE_TMPFS=false"`.


#### Using prebuilt containers
```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
