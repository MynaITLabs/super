# A Secure Programmable Router

## Introduction

This project creates a hardened router setup for connecting IOT devices or running an entire home network. 
By employing per-station passphrases and strict firewall rules, a hardened network is created.
The project enables a high degree of confidence about where packets come from and where they can actually go,
with protections against MAC cloaking/spoofing and fine grained access controls. 

## Goals
1. Security & Privacy
2. Programmable with an API 
3. Easy to use
